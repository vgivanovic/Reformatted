\chapter{Preface}
\begin{comment}
  Staff writers for \textit{The New Yorker} are demi-gods. John McPhee, Malcolm Gladwell, Jill Lepore, Joan Didion and Atul Gawande share the pantheon of superb non-fiction writing with a hundred or so others. Janet Malcolm, who died in June 2021, was one of them. Katie Roiphe said of Malcolm's writing, ``She takes apart the official line, the accepted story, the court transcript like a mechanic takes apart a car engine and shows us how it works; she narrates how the stories we tell ourselves are made from the vanities and jealousies and weaknesses of their players. This is her obsession, and no one can do it on her level.''\footnote{Quoted by Katharine Q. Seelye in her obituary of Janet Malcolm in the \textit{New York Times}, June 18, 2021, ``Janet Malcolm, Provocative Journalist With a Piercing Eye, Dies at 86''.}

  I want to take apart the official line of charter school advocates, to show how the system works, and to expose the motivations of the players. And if my writing is just a simulacrum of Malcolm's, I will have achieved my goal.
