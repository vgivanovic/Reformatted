This chapter discusses the result of exploring answers to my research question: Has Rocketship structured itself and its finances, to earn a return to investors, focusing especially on real estate transactions, and if so, how?

\subsection{Property Acquisition Timeline}

\section{The Data}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item What is the actual price, date, and buyer \& seller information for each property?
  \item What is the legal relationship between Rocketship Education and Launchpad Development?
  \item How were Rocketship facilities in Santa Clara County financed?
  \item What are the type and terms of all bonds.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item What bonds were floated: type, rate, \& terms; guaranteed by whom or how? \\
    \noindent Since these are securities, their prospectuses are filed with the Securities Exchange Commission, and I assume that info is on their web site.
    \item For conduit bonds, look on the California Department of Education or Department of Finance web sites.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Enumerate all known leases and their terms. Was part of the lease payment paid by California?
  \item Enumerate all known loans.
  \begin{enumerate}[a.]
    \item What was used as collateral? 
    \item What were the terms?
  \end{enumerate}    
  \item Enumerate donations from foundations and individuals.
  \item Enumerate venture fund investments.
\end{enumerate}

These data represent the monies that are flowing into Rocketship/Launchpad related to facilities, real estate, bonds, loans, and donations and not tied to the number of students. Once that's been assembled, roll up into one spreadsheet, Rocketship's consolidated financial statements for the fourteen years (2008--2022). The consolidated financial statements can then be compared against the known real estate, bond, loan, and donation transactions. Noe where data is missing or where it conflicts with the consolidated financial statements.

Forms which have been filed with a government entity:
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item Federal 990 forms to check against financial statements. IRS maintained. Should cross-reference the financial statements.
  \item Annual and interim budgets submitted to the California Department of Education.
  \item Petition approvals and renewals submitted to local school districts, the SCCOE, or the California State Board of Education.

  The Santa Clara County Office of Education (SCCOE), and each school district in which Rocketship petitioned to open a school has some data/notes from one or more board meetings in which the petition or renewal was discussed. These data might have been presented by Rocketship or by county or district staff. Sometimes there is also public comment.
  
Often, petitions presented to a school district have been denied and appealed to the Santa Clara County Board of Education, and in a few cases, to California's State Board of Education.
  
  \item There is some published material on Rocketship.
  \begin{enumerate}[a.]
    \item Some books have been written about Rocketship
    \item Roxana has two ScoopIt collections on Rocketship on and charter schools.
    \item The ``Stop Rocketship'' web site has lots of information on Rocketship.
    \item Several academics have datasets of school or district financial information  which include Rocketship.
    \item Numerous articles, web sites, and blog postings include Rocketship financial data.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Other, outside entities that may add revenue to Rocketship
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Zeal
    \item Dreambox Learning
  \end{enumerate}
